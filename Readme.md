## Covid360: Risk Modeling and Simulation Framework
</header>


This code allows us to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in urban environments (e.g. a city).

To use the code we have first specify the parameters in the config.json file, which represents a given scenario, and then run the simulations by executing the run_simulation.py file locally on the machine.

```python run_simulation.py```

In the config.json file, we have several parameters. These parameters include the population size, the number of different locations, the epidemic model parameters and the parameters to specify different scenarios e.g., lockdowns, self-isolation and contact tracing. A description of these parameters is given below:

# Parameters in the config.json file: 

|Parameter Name|Parameter Description
|---|---|
|**start_date**| specify the start date of the simulation
|entity_counts| specify the number for each of the 6 location types, which are residential, school, retail (shopping mall), employment, hospital and market.

"POPULATION": The number of individuals in the simulation.

"SCALE_FACTOR": Not used. 

"INTERVENTION_INFO": A lockdown can be enforced by setting the "flag" parameter to true. The types of locations locked are specified in "locked_entities"; set the value to true to enable lockdown of that location type. The lockdown comes into effect once the number of active cases exceeds "threshold_infected". The lockdown is lifted after the active cases drop below "lift_lockdown_threshold". And the entities kept in lockdown after the lift is specified in "lockdown_entities_after_lift". Finally, the "COMPLIANCE_RATE" is a parameter that specifies the percentage of the population (to be set b/w 0 and 1) that complies with the lockdown instructions.

"save_agent_list": Set it to true if the output individual data needs to be saved in a csv file.

"COMPLIANCE_RATE": A general compliance rate factor. Not used.

"ZONE_INTERVENTION_INFO": In the simulations, hypthetical zones are created using K-means. If a specific zone needs to be locked down, it can be done using this parameter. The zones to be locked can be specified in "ZONE_ID" (it is a list) and each zone will be locked if the number of active cases exceeds "ZONE_THRESHOLD_INFECTED". The "SEQUENTIAL" parameter can be used to enable a scenario where zones are locked down only one at time.

"NUM_ZONES": A parameter to specify the number of zones to be created using K-means.

"SELF_ISOLATION": The scenario of Self isolation can be enabled by setting the "flag" parameter in this dictionary to true. In this scenario, infected individuals who get symptomatic will isolate at their residences until they recover. The "COMPLIANCE_RATE" gives the percentage of the population who complies with self isolation.

"HOSPITALIZATION": To enable hospitalization, i.e., individuals who get infected and get symptomatic can be hospitalized based on their age.

"MASK_COMPLIANCE": To enable mask compliance. "threshold" specifies the number of active cases after which we enable mask wearing. "MASK_INFECTION_FACTOR" provides the probability factors (two values: wears mask, does not wear a mask) that are used to reduce the probability of infection.

"CONTACT_TRACING": The parameter to enable contact tracing. "PAST_DAYS" considers the past number of days. "ISOLATION_PERIOD" specifies the period of isolation in days. "threshold_infected" specifies the number of active cases after which we enable contact tracing.

"TESTING_INFO": To enable the scenario of COVID-19 testing. "daily_rate" specifies the rate of daily testing. "threshold_infected" specifies the number of active cases after which we enable testting.

"ASYMPTOMATIC_RATIO_IN_RECOVERY_MODEL": To specify the ratio of the number of asymptomatic cases.

"MAX_DAYS_OF_INFECTION": the max number of days of infection. A person will recover between 12 to 30 days or die within this period.

"INFECTION_RATE_FACTOR": A factor to descrease the infectiousness. A higher factor corresponds to reduced infectiousness. 

"w_shape": A parameter for the infectiousness model (Weibull distribution)

"w_scale": A parameter for the infectiousness model (Weibull distribution)

"meanlog": A parameter for the incubation time distribution (lognormal)

"sdlog": A parameter for the incubation time distribution (lognormal)

"NUMBER_ITERATIONS_PER_DAY": Currently hardcoded as 5. 

"get_risk": Not used. Planned to get risks in the simulation if needed.
